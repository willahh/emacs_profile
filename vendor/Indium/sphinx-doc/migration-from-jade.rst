Migration from Jade
===================

``Indium`` was previously known as ``Jade``.  The project was renamed because of
trademark issues.

If you already have ``Jade`` installed, you should first uninstall it with::

  M-x package-uninstall RET jade RET

If you have ``.jade`` marker files in your projects, simply rename them to ``.indium`` (see :ref:`local-files`).
