Indium is a JavaScript development environment for `Emacs <http://gnu.org/software/emacs>`_.

Indium is Free Software, licensed under the GPL v3.0.  You can follow its
development on `GitHub <https://github.com/NicolasPetton/indium>`_.

Indium connects to a browser tab or nodejs process and provides several features
for JavaScript development, including:

* a REPL (with auto completion) & object inspection;
* an inspector, with history and navigation;
* a scratch buffer (``M-x indium-scratch``);
* JavaScript evaluation in JS buffers with ``indium-interaction-mode``;
* a stepping Debugger, similar to ``edebug``, or ``cider``.

This documentation can be read online at https://indium.readthedocs.io.

It is also available in Info format and can be consulted from within Emacs with
``C-h i m indium RET``.
